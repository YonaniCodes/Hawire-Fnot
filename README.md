6.Configuring Environment Variables

To properly set up your environment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env` file**In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.env`.
2. **Add the following environment variables**
   Open the `.env` file and add the following configuration:

   ODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000
   DB_URI=mongodb+srv://`<username>`:`<password>`@cluster.mongodb.net/yourdatabase
   JWT_SECRET=yourjwtsecret
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=[your-email@example.com]()
   EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password

   3.

   - Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.
   - Set `yourjwtsecret` to a secure secret key for signing JWT tokens.
   - Enter your email SMTP server details if you're using email functionality.

   3. **Save the `.env` file**
      Once youâ€™ve updated the `.env` file, save it.

   These variables will be used by the application for various configurations like database connection, email handling, and JWT token management.

   Once the `.env` file is configured, you can start the application as usual.
